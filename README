Instructions:

	Create a basic app that will take in a given list of objects and then group them all by a field 
	then sort each group by another field. Filter out any objects where key data is null.

	For example, given a list of items, separate them by item.listId then sort them by item.name, 
	removing any items with a blank or null name.

Interpretation:

	Since it was to be an APP, I decided to do it in proper MVC style allowing for future expansion.
